# Mapty
Welcome to the Mapty App. This app was built following a tutorial as part of <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course'>The Complete Javascript Course</a> by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

The application allows users to pinpoint locations of cylcing/running workouts on a map and enter workout metrics. Browser local storage is used to store user input. 

The project was built using Vanilla JS and developed using OOP principles.
